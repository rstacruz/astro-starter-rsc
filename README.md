# astro-starter-rsc

I often use Astro to prototype new ideas, but I find myself adding the same integrations over and over.
This starter is a collection of my favorite integrations.

- Astro
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Vitest
- Eslint
- Prettier
- pnpm
- GitHub Actions
- ~~Playwright~~ (coming soon)
- ~~Storybook~~ (coming soon)

## Getting started

```sh
# to enable pnpm: corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
open http://localhost:4321/
```
